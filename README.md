V.	Reflection
    a.	Addition – It was an easy task. Addition was just binary addition in mod 2.
    b.	Subtraction – Easiest task as it was just the same with addition.
    c.	Multiplication – It was a challenge. I was thinking of how to multiply polynomials or multiply binary, but a thought came into my mind. I could just convert the input to decimal, multiply them, and then output the binary. For the reduction using P(x), I had to search online for methods because I was running out of ideas on how to implement polynomial division with modulo P(x). Special thanks to Rosetta Code for giving me the idea of using synthetic division.
    d.	Division – Since the reduction is the same as polynomial division, implementing division for the program was a breeze.
    e.	Validation – Since it was explicitly said in project specifications the input format, I did not dwell on this much. Input will be calculated in mod 2 first before calculations are done. And the sign must be inputted for the operation.
